					</div>  
					<div className="flexRow">
						<p className="boldStyles flexRowL">CHALLENGE:</p>
						<p className="pStyles flexRowL">Studies have shown that 1 in 10 adults in the US have a food allergy. 
						Many are unable to eat meals from restaurants due to these dietary restrictions. 
						Although many restaurants can make accommodations in meal preparation to meet these dietary 
						restrictions, this isnâ€™t a widely known option.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div className="flexRow">
						<p className="boldStyles flexRowL">OBJECTIVE:</p>
						<p className="pStyles flexRowL">Design a better UX for both desktop and mobile that allows people with 
						dietary restrictions to feel more inclusive in the food preparation and ordering process.

					<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
					<div>
						<p className="boldStyles flexRowL">USERS WANT OPTIONS, JUST NOT TOO MANY</p>
						<p className="pStyles flexRowL">One of the assumptions I made originally was offering users 
						multiple options, whether it be multiple locations to view the menu or multiple menu customization 
						buttons, was going to be helpful and decrease the time a user takes to order their food. 
						This turned out to be wrong. It only caused more confusion and frustration due to information 
						overload. Through testing I finally found a sweet spot to determine how many pre-set menu 
						customization buttons to use that would create a more inculsive user experience for people with food 
						allergies.
